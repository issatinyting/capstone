            <h2> Rumi: Queen of Secrecy, Song & Shadow </h2>
            <p> If you’ve ever swooned over a character who fights demons and also fights her own identity—you need to
                meet Rumi. She’s the lead vocalist and fierce leader of HUNTR/X, a K‑pop girl group whose glow onstage
                only hints at how heavy her life really is </p>
            <!-- This is a comment -->

            <ul>
                <li> Rumi is half-demon, which is her secret. Her mom was human (and a former demon hunter idol), and
                    her father was a demon. Her mother died when Rumi was born; she was raised by Celine (a fellow
                    hunter/idol) who tries to protect Rumi by making her hide her demon side </li>
                <li> The biggest thing is that she’s constantly hiding part of herself — her demon markings, her voice
                    strain, the fear that people (especially Mira & Zoey) will reject her if they find out. </li>
                <li> At first it’s all about protecting her image, protecting her friends, protecting the Honmoon (this
                    magical barrier she and her group uphold to keep demons at bay). She believes that if the Honmoon
                    turns gold, it might “erase” her demonic marks.
                    But through the story, she starts realizing that hiding isn’t healing. She confronts betrayal,
                    rejection, shame—all the stuff we hide from in real life—and begins to accept the “demon” half of
                    herself, realizing it’s part of her strength, not just something to be ashamed of.</li>

                <h2> Mira Huntrix — A Fan Girl’s Bio</h2>
                <p><strong>Stage Role:</strong> Visual & Main Dancer of Huntr/x, the triple-threat idol-demon-slayer we
                    all stan.</p>
                <p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Born into a strict chaebol family, Mira broke away to chase her passion —
                    K-pop stardom and demon justice. That rebellious queen energy? Yes please.</p>
                <p><strong>Why She’s Everything:</strong> She's cool on the outside, loyal to the bone, and fights
                    demons with the elegance of a runway model wielding a polearm. 💅</p>
                <p><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> A <em>woldo</em> — it’s long, lethal, and matches her deadly grace
                    on stage and in battle.</p>
                <p><strong>Fave Moment:</strong> That scene where she twirls mid-dance, slices a demon mid-beat, and
                    doesn’t miss a single choreo step. Literal chills.</p>
